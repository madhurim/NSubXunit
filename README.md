# NSubXunit
Some demo code for XUnit and NSubstitute
This project demonstrates Unit testing with XUnit and NSubstitute. 
About 20 different tests that demonstrate stubs , mocks and data driven tests using Xunit.
There are unit test examples for async methods as well.
Still in development. More tests will be added.

XUnit is extensible with Custom attributes.
NSubstitute has very simple and readable syntax for mocking and stubbing.
